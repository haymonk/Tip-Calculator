## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

The following **optional** features are implemented:

## Notes

This is my first time writing code in Swift and using Xcode, so I messed around with various objects in the library and spent additional time looking over the Swift documentation and experimenting basic features in Xcode. The most challenging component of the calculator was implementing the reset button to clear the values and reset the segmented control.
